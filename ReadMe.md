# Project Title: CryptogramCrusher

# Cipher Decrypter
This program compares two text files, one has been encrypted with a Caesar cipher 
and the other is a random English Article taken online. 
The Most Boring Thing Ever Written (https://www.brade.zone/2008/09/13/boring/).  
Using bar plots and the panda's dataframe, the most common letter from both articles 
was calculated and they were aligned together, in order to calculate the shift of 
the alphabet used.

Sample output:

# AES Encrypt
This program is used to encrypt a message in a file named `SecureMessage.txt` 
to `AES-128.dat` and then decrypts the encrypted file `AES-128.dat` to 
`DecryptedMessage.txt`. There are two main files for this program, `send.py` 
and `receive.py`.

# ChecksumCracker
This program calculates a checksum for a string taken from a text file and 
tries to crack it by using a different string of characters with the same checksum.
