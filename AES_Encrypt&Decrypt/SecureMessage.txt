                How_TO_ENCRYPT_A_MESSAGE 

1) Get a Ink: Use vinegar, or milk or any other hydrogen peroxide.

2) Write the message: Dip a cotton swab, a brush, and
    feather into the invisible ink and write your message on a piece of paper. 

3) Treat the message: Once the ink has dried, hold the paper near a light bulb
     or heat source to make the message visible.
